# Workout Pal
This project follows the tutorial of the youtube channel [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja/featured) on creating a [MERN stack project](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE&si=maQ2xpMLSgR4tgPP).</br>
#### Notice
MERN refers to:</br>
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React
- Node.js</hr>
# Project Process
The project, as with any other app, is divided into 2 parts:
1. Backend
2. Frontend
3. Linking</br>
## Backend:
The backend of the project is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current), Express.js and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). We start by installing some required packages using NPM (which comes along with node.js). Then, the basic idea is to create the routes first, followed by the models needed and finally the controllers which will basically contain the logic.
## Frontend:
The frontend is created using [React](https://react.dev/), a powerful JS library used to create single-page apps. The first step after setting up React is to create the main pages and setup the routing. Following that, we create any needed components for our work.
## Linking
The linking step is where we actually start interacting with the database from the frontend, and is done by creating functions in the frontend to fetch data from the backend where needed.
